### Hey! ðŸ‘‹
I work as a software developer at [Generative](https://generative.vision/), and I maintain several open-source Elm packages including:

- [`elm-units`](https://github.com/ianmackenzie/elm-units)
- [`elm-geometry`](https://github.com/ianmackenzie/elm-geometry)
- [`elm-3d-scene`](https://github.com/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene)

I'm interested in:

- 3D geometry
- Computer-aided design (CAD)
- Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)
- Using those to help address the climate crisis!

You can generally find me (**@ianmackenzie**) on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/); I tend to hang out mostly in the **#geometry** and **#webgl** channels.
